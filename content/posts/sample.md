## Description of the sample post

This is a test of the layout of post pages.  The main text should be in a centered column 800 pixels wide.  There should be a column to the left for table of contents, and a column to the right for categories and tags.

## Description of the Table of Contents

The page also lists the table of contents of the post in the left sidebar.  Each link is clickable.  Note that this starts with h2 headings only.

### Indentation

The table of contents isn't currently indented, which makes it difficult to read.
