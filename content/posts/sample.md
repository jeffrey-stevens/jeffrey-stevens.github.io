## Description of the sample post

This is a test of the layout of post pages.  The main text should be in a centered column 800 pixels wide.  There should be a column to the left for table of contents, and a column to the right for categories and tags.

## Description of the Table of Contents

The page also lists the table of contents of the post in the left sidebar.  Each link is clickable.  Note that this starts with h2 headings only.

### ToC Levels

The table of contents only lists headers two levels deep.  The second level is indented by 10px.

#### Proof of correct level depth

This demonstrates that only the top two heading levels are shown in the ToC.

### Other content

Here is some other content.

## Back to first level

This is more content at the first level.
